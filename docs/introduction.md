## What is PhUssd?
PhUssd is a non-opinionated USSD library for PHP. It is designed to be entirely customisable by the developer.

## Getting Started With USSD
Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) is a communications protocol used by GSM cellular telephones to 
communicate with the mobile network operator's computers. USSD can be used for WAP browsing, prepaid callback service, 
mobile-money services, location-based content services, menu-based information services, and as part of configuring the 
phone on the network.

USSD messages are up to 182 alphanumeric characters long. Unlike Short Message Service (SMS) messages, USSD messages 
create a real-time connection during a USSD session. The connection remains open, allowing a two-way exchange of a 
sequence of data. This makes USSD more responsive than services that use SMS.[~ Wikipedia]()
